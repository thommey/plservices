PLservices are P10 Lua-scriptable services, intended for the use on 
snircd.

Requirements:
  * Judy - "C library that provides a state-of-the-art core technology that implements a sparse dynamic array."
      @ http://judy.sourceforge.net/ (LGPL 2.1)
  * Lua - "a powerful, fast, lightweight, embeddable scripting language."
      @ http://www.lua.org (MIT license)

Compiling:
  make

Runtime arguments: ./plservices <ip> <port> <pass> <servername> <server description>.

At the moment it instantly attempts to load ./labspace.lua after ./stubs.lua into the same lua interpreter.
stubs.lua is included, labspace.lua is over at http://hg.quakenet.org/lua-labspace/ - put it into the working directory.
